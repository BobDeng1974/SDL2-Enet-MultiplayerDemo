# -SDL2-Enet-MultiplayerDemo
A simple demo made with SDL2 graphic lib and Enet network lib

If Linux, you need to build Enet with:
./configure && make && sudo make install
inside Engine/enet-1.3.13/ folder

If windows, just link enet.lib or enet64.lib inside Engine/enet-1.3.13/ folder
Don't forget to also link ws2_32.lib and winmm.lib

Soon more information about building the project
